This is a card game made based on a mini game called Triple Triad from an old PS1 game called Final Fantasy 8
It is made using html5/javascript.

Triple Triad is a card game for 2 players. 
The goal is to win cards by playing against other players.
The board is constituted of a 3 x 3 grid. 
Both players put one of their cards on the board at each turn until the board is filled. 
Cards have a strength on each direction (top, right, bottom and left) and may be of an element.
Strength goes from 1 to A (10). The elements are : thunder, rock, ice, wind, poison, fire, water and holy. 
There are no elements more powerful than another, and you can decide to play without minding it (see Special rules).
When playing a card on the board, if your card is adjacent to an opponent's card then it's a battle, 
if the strength on the battle side or your card is greater than the opponent's strength of its card's battle side, 
you win the battle and the card will flip to your color. 
If your strength is lesser or equal nothing happens. 
Everytime you win a battle you gain one point while your opponent loses one. 
At the beginning of the game, you have 5 points. 
At the end the player with the most points wins, in case of equality it is a draw.
